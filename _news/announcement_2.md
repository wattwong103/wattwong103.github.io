Embarking on a New Chapter: My Journey with the Pheu Thai Party

Raw ambition meets thoughtful governance—this is how I envision my journey as I step into a pivotal role at the Pheu Thai Party. The call to serve my country by shaping transportation policies and planning public infrastructure is one that I’ve eagerly answered. This new chapter is not just a career move; it’s a commitment to innovation and social betterment.

In my role, I am diving deep into the intricate world of public transportation data analysis, with a focus on the Household Travel Survey 2022 from the Ministry of Transport. My goal? To generate actionable insights that will influence the way public transportation is designed and implemented across Thailand. But this isn’t just about crunching numbers—this is about creating policies that truly serve the people, making their daily commutes more efficient, reliable, and sustainable.

Key Areas of Focus
<ul> <li>Analyzing transportation data to inform policy decisions</li> <li>Designing bus routes and incentives for public transport mode shifting</li> <li>Enhancing data and policy infrastructures within the party</li> </ul>
As I continue to navigate through the complex terrains of transportation planning, I am also tasked with planning new bus routes and developing incentives to encourage a shift towards public transportation in Lad Krabang, Bangkok. This project, backed by a ministerial grant, underscores the importance of strategic urban planning in promoting sustainable urban mobility.

This journey with the Pheu Thai Party is about more than just policies and planning. It’s about being part of a team that believes in the power of data-driven decision-making and the potential for positive change in every Thai citizen’s life.

As I grow in this new role, I look forward to contributing to a future where our transportation systems are not only efficient but also equitable and accessible to all. Stay tuned as I share more about this exciting journey and the innovative projects we’ll be rolling out in the coming months.
