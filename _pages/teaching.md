Throughout my teaching journey, I have developed and curated a comprehensive range of materials designed to enrich the learning experience for students. These resources have been meticulously crafted to align with the curriculum objectives while also fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

## National Geography Olympiad Syllabus and Curriculum
In my role as a Lecturer and Faculty Advisor at Mahidol Wittayanusorn School, I created a specialized syllabus for the National Geography Olympiad. The materials include:

<ul> <li>Detailed lesson plans covering both physical and human geography</li> <li>Fieldwork guides focusing on geographic data collection and analysis</li> <li>Practice exams and mock tests based on past Olympiad papers</li> <li>Interactive activities to enhance spatial thinking and map interpretation skills</li> </ul>

## Geography Fieldwork and Human Geography Training
As part of the Olympiad preparation, I also developed training modules that covered essential geography fieldwork techniques and advanced topics in human geography. These materials aimed to:

<ul> <li>Equip students with practical skills for conducting geographical research</li> <li>Introduce advanced concepts such as urbanization, migration, and environmental management</li> <li>Provide case studies and examples to illustrate the application of geographic theories</li> </ul>

## Transportation Engineering and Planning
In the university setting, I have taught various courses related to transportation engineering and planning. The teaching materials for these courses include:

<ul> <li>Lecture slides on transportation modeling, including four-step sequential modeling and discrete choice modeling</li> <li>Case studies on urban transportation planning and policy implementation</li> <li>Datasets and software tutorials for travel behavior surveys and statistical analysis</li> <li>Project guidelines for practical assignments, such as traffic simulation and public transportation network design</li> </ul>
These materials have been integral in helping students grasp complex concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios. By focusing on both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, I aim to prepare students for the challenges they will face in their professional careers.
