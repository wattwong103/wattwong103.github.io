  <h3>Notes</h3>
  TODM focused on gathering information from free tools or open resources in the same place. The intention is to help
  people find free resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for a cost.<br>

  <p>I originally created this mapping with an transportation infrastructure point of view. I would love to include any
    other resources, especially from fields outside of transportation. Please let me know about anything that might be
    missing!</p>
